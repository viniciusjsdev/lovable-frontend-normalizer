# App Factory Skills

Codex skills for turning a rough idea into a Lovable-generated MVP, then into a normalized frontend, planned Django backend and deploy-ready infrastructure.

Build faster. Keep the handoffs explicit. Do not let the agent guess the project into existence.

App Factory Skills is a small skill catalog for MVP and prototype projects. It is designed for a human + AI workflow:

1. The user brings a PRD, rough idea or product notes.
2. Codex creates a strong Lovable prompt.
3. The user pastes that prompt into Lovable.
4. Lovable generates the frontend.
5. Codex normalizes the frontend, creates backend specs, builds the backend after review, then prepares infrastructure.

The key rule: every stage consumes explicit artifacts from the previous one. If the required context is missing, the skill should stop and tell the user what is missing instead of inventing the project.

## Flow

```txt
Idea or PRD
  -> lovable-prompt-architect
  -> user pastes prompt into Lovable
  -> Lovable generates frontend code
  -> lovable-frontend-normalizer
  -> backend planning specs
  -> django-backend-service-architect
  -> app-factory-infra-orchestrator
  -> MVP ready for technical validation
```

| Stage | Input | Skill | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Pre-production | PRD, notes or rough idea | `lovable-prompt-architect` | Lovable-ready prompt |
| 2. Front generation | Prompt | Lovable | Generated frontend code |
| 3. Front normalization | Lovable frontend | `lovable-frontend-normalizer` | Clean frontend, mocks behind services, API contract |
| 4. Backend specs | Product/frontend/API contracts | `django-backend-service-architect` | Backend plan, domain model, API/security contracts and validation plan |
| 5. Backend implementation | Accepted backend specs | `django-backend-service-architect` | Django backend with service architecture |
| 6. Infrastructure | Frontend/backend project shape | `app-factory-infra-orchestrator` | Docker, Supabase, Vercel, Render/VPS and deploy docs |

## Install

Install all skills into your local Codex skill directory:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem .\skills -Directory | ForEach-Object {
  Copy-Item -Recurse $_.FullName (Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE ".codex\skills\$($_.Name)") -Force
}
```

Install one skill:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse .\skills\lovable-prompt-architect $env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\lovable-prompt-architect -Force
```

After installing, open the target MVP project in Codex and call the skill by name:

```txt
Use $lovable-frontend-normalizer to normalize this Lovable frontend. Preserve all UI/UX.
```

## Skills

| Skill | Use when | Does not do |
|---|---|---|
| `lovable-prompt-architect` | You have an app idea, PRD or rough product brief and need a Lovable prompt. | Does not edit code. |
| `lovable-frontend-normalizer` | You have Lovable-generated frontend code. | Does not remove screens, flows, copy, mocks or visual identity unless asked. |
| `django-backend-service-architect` | You have enough product/frontend/API context to plan and build a Django backend. | Does not create backend code before backend specs exist and decisions are summarized. |
| `app-factory-infra-orchestrator` | You have frontend/backend structure and need Docker, Supabase, Vercel, Render or VPS support. | Does not pretend there is only one production path. |

## Usage

Start from a rough idea:

```txt
Use $lovable-prompt-architect to turn this product idea into a complete Lovable prompt.
```

After Lovable generates the frontend:

```txt
Use $lovable-frontend-normalizer to normalize this Lovable frontend. Preserve all UI/UX.
```

After frontend normalization creates API contracts:

```txt
Use $django-backend-service-architect to create the backend specs for this App Factory project.
```

After reviewing/accepting the backend specs:

```txt
Use $django-backend-service-architect to implement the Django backend from the accepted specs.
```

After frontend and backend structure exist:

```txt
Use $app-factory-infra-orchestrator to create Docker, Supabase, Vercel and Render-ready infrastructure for this App Factory project.
```

## Safety Gates

These skills are intentionally conservative. They are meant to be used by AI agents, so the instructions include hard stops.

| Area | Guardrail |
|---|---|
| Lovable prompt | Produces prompt only. The user still generates the frontend in Lovable. |
| Frontend | Preserve UI/UX, routes, copy, mocks and interactions unless explicitly requested. |
| Backend | Create backend specs first. Do not create Django implementation files unless preflight passed, specs exist and decisions were summarized. |
| Security | Backend API contracts must include auth, permissions, rate limits, sensitive data rules and logout/session invalidation when relevant. |
| Infrastructure | Do not hardcode secrets. Do not claim local or production readiness unless validation was attempted. |
| Supabase | Document schema ownership, RLS, SSL, network restrictions, MFA, indexes/performance and backups/PITR when relevant. |
| Render | Treat Render as an optional Django backend host. Document native Python vs Docker, env vars, migrations, static files and CORS. |

## What The Backend Skill Enforces

The Django skill uses a service-layer architecture:

```txt
HTTP -> View/Controller -> Serializer/DTO -> Service -> Model
HTTP -> View/Controller -> Selector -> Model
```

It requires:

- PRD/spec/frontend context before code generation
- backend planning specs before implementation
- decision summary to the user before implementation
- API contract before endpoints
- environment-driven settings
- CORS by environment
- rate limiting/throttling, considering IP and authenticated user when relevant
- explicit auth and permission rules
- logout/session/token invalidation strategy
- sensitive data masking, omission or encryption rules when data reaches the frontend
- tests for services, selectors, API paths and permission behavior

Required backend specs in target projects:

```txt
docs/architecture/backend-plan.md
docs/architecture/domain-model.md
docs/architecture/api-contract.md
docs/architecture/security-contract.md
docs/architecture/backend-validation-plan.md
```

## Infrastructure Targets

The infra skill supports multiple deployment modes without forcing one production path.

| Component | Default direction | Alternatives |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Vercel from `frontend/` | Static container or another frontend host |
| Backend | Django container or Render web service | Railway, Fly.io, VPS, compatible container host |
| Database/Auth/Storage | Supabase when configured | Render Postgres or another Postgres provider when explicitly chosen |
| Local development | Docker Compose | Supabase CLI local stack when Supabase-specific services are needed |

Frontend projects are normalized to npm by default. pnpm, yarn or bun should remain only when the user or project docs explicitly require that exception.

Render support covers:

- native Python web service
- Docker web service from `backend/Dockerfile.prod`
- optional `render.yaml` Blueprint
- build/start/pre-deploy commands
- migrations
- `DATABASE_URL`, `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, `DJANGO_DEBUG=False`, `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- static files via WhiteNoise or equivalent
- CORS from Vercel preview/production domains
- secrets with `sync: false`, `generateValue: true`, env groups or dashboard-managed values

## Validation

Validate a skill after editing:

```powershell
python C:\Users\welli\.codex\skills\.system\skill-creator\scripts\quick_validate.py .\skills\django-backend-service-architect
```

Run available scanners from a target project:

```powershell
node .\skills\lovable-frontend-normalizer\scripts\scan-lovable-frontend.mjs
python .\skills\django-backend-service-architect\scripts\scan-django-architecture.py
node .\skills\app-factory-infra-orchestrator\scripts\scan-infra.mjs
```

## Philosophy

Fast MVPs need speed, but not guesswork.

This repository exists to make Codex repeat the same high-quality product path: clarify the idea, generate the frontend prompt, normalize Lovable output, build the backend from contracts, and create infrastructure with honest validation notes.

No hidden production assumptions. No backend from vibes. No infra that only works on paper.
