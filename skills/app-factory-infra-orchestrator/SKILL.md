# App Factory Infra Orchestrator

## Purpose

Create and normalize infrastructure for App Factory projects.

The standard repository has:

```txt
frontend/
backend/
supabase/
docs/
.agents/skills/
.codex/
docker-compose.yml
docker-compose.prod.yml
Makefile
.env.example
AGENTS.md
README.md
```

## Core Principle

Local must be easy. Production must be explicit. Vercel must not be confused with a generic Docker host.

Use Docker for local orchestration and backend deployability. Use Vercel for frontend deployment from `/frontend`. Use Supabase for managed Postgres/Auth/Storage when configured. Use Render as a supported backend hosting option when the project needs managed Django web service hosting without managing a VPS.

Do not promise one production path. Support local/full Docker, VPS/full-stack container deployment, Vercel-native frontend deployment, backend container deployment on Render or similar hosts, Render native Python deployment when appropriate, and Supabase-managed services.

## Modes

### Local / Full Docker

Use for local development and full-stack smoke testing:

- frontend container
- backend container
- local db container when not using remote Supabase
- shared Docker network
- hot reload when practical

### Cloud Split

Use for common MVP deployment:

- frontend on Vercel from `/frontend`
- backend on Render, VPS, Railway, Fly.io or compatible host
- Supabase as managed Postgres/Auth/Storage

## Load References

Read the relevant references before changing files:

- `references/root-architecture-standard.md`
- `references/docker-compose-standard.md`
- `references/frontend-docker-standard.md`
- `references/backend-docker-standard.md`
- `references/supabase-standard.md`
- `references/vercel-standard.md`
- `references/render-standard.md`
- `references/env-standard.md`
- `references/validation-checklist.md`

Run `scripts/scan-infra.mjs` after changes when possible.

## Root Architecture

Expected root:

```txt
/
  frontend/
  backend/
  supabase/
  docs/
  .agents/
    skills/
  .codex/
  docker-compose.yml
  docker-compose.override.yml
  docker-compose.prod.yml
  Makefile
  .env.example
  AGENTS.md
  README.md
```

## Docker Compose Standard

Create `docker-compose.yml` for local development.

Required services when available:

```txt
frontend
backend
db
```

`db` is optional when the project uses remote Supabase only. If included, clearly label it as a local development fallback.

Recommended ports:

```txt
frontend: 5173 or app-specific dev port
backend: 8000
db: 5432
```

Use named volumes for database data, a shared network and healthchecks where practical.

Do not put secrets directly in compose files. Read from root `.env`.

## Frontend Docker Standard

Create:

```txt
frontend/Dockerfile
frontend/Dockerfile.prod
frontend/.dockerignore
```

Development Dockerfile should:

- use Node LTS image
- install dependencies with npm by default
- support Vite/TanStack/React dev server
- bind to `0.0.0.0`
- expose the correct dev port
- preserve hot reload when mounted via Compose

Production Dockerfile should:

- build static frontend
- serve using nginx or another lightweight static server when running outside Vercel
- not be required for Vercel native deploy

Important: Vercel deployment should use the `/frontend` root directory and framework build command/output directory, not the frontend Dockerfile, unless the deployment platform explicitly supports custom containers.

## Backend Docker Standard

Create:

```txt
backend/Dockerfile
backend/Dockerfile.prod
backend/.dockerignore
backend/entrypoint.sh
```

Development backend should install Python dependencies, run Django development server, expose port `8000`, and mount source for fast development.

Production backend should use a slim Python image, install only required dependencies, run migrations explicitly or through a controlled entrypoint, collect static files if needed, run gunicorn, expose port `8000`, and use environment variables.

Do not hardcode secrets.

## Render Standard

Use Render when the MVP needs a hosted Django API without managing a VPS.

Supported Render backend paths:

- native Python web service
- Docker web service built from `backend/Dockerfile.prod`
- `render.yaml` Blueprint when the project wants infrastructure-as-code

For Django on Render, document:

- service root or Dockerfile path for monorepos
- build command
- start command
- pre-deploy command for migrations when used
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` or equivalent
- `DJANGO_DEBUG=False`
- `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` including `.onrender.com` host and custom domains
- `RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME` handling when used
- static file strategy such as WhiteNoise or external object storage
- `WEB_CONCURRENCY` or worker strategy
- health check path
- environment groups and secret handling

If generating `render.yaml`, never hardcode secrets. Use `sync: false`, `generateValue: true`, Render environment groups, or dashboard-managed values for secrets.

Do not put Render-only assumptions into local Docker Compose. Keep Render deployment docs separate from local development docs.

## Environment Standard

Create:

```txt
.env.example
frontend/.env.example
backend/.env.example
```

Root `.env.example` should include:

```env
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=app_factory_project

FRONTEND_PORT=5173
BACKEND_PORT=8000

VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.local
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=change-me
DJANGO_DEBUG=True
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,backend

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/app

SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
```

Never commit real secrets.

## Supabase Standard

Create when Supabase is part of the stack:

```txt
supabase/
  migrations/
  seed.sql
  config.toml
```

Use Supabase when the product needs managed Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime or Edge Functions.

For Django-backed products:

- Django can connect to Supabase Postgres through `DATABASE_URL`.
- Django migrations can remain the source of truth for backend-owned domain tables.
- Supabase migrations can be used for Auth/Storage/RLS-specific resources.
- If Supabase SQL migrations are the source of truth for all schema, document that decision clearly.

Do not create conflicting schema ownership silently.

For local Supabase development, prefer Supabase CLI structure and migrations. Keep `supabase/config.toml`, migrations and seed files versioned when generated.

Supabase CLI uses Docker for the local stack. Do not duplicate Supabase services inside the app Compose file unless there is a documented reason. On untrusted public networks, document binding the local Supabase stack to localhost and never expose the local Supabase stack publicly.

Production readiness must be documented rather than assumed. Include a Supabase checklist covering Security Advisor, RLS, SSL enforcement, network restrictions, MFA, access control, custom SMTP/Auth email settings, Auth rate limits, CAPTCHA/abuse prevention when relevant, indexes/performance review, load testing for expected launch traffic, backups/PITR when needed, and secret handling.

The Supabase anon key may be used by frontend code only when RLS and policies are correctly designed. The service role key must stay server-side only and must never appear in `frontend/.env.example`, Vercel frontend env vars, client code or logs.

## Vercel Standard

Frontend deploy target:

```txt
Root Directory: frontend
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist or framework-specific output
```

Create `frontend/vercel.json` only when needed.

For monorepos, document that the Vercel project root directory should be `frontend`. When using Vercel CLI with a monorepo, run linking/deploy commands from the monorepo root and select the intended Vercel project.

Prefer Vercel's framework/build auto-detection. Override build command, install command or output directory only when the detected values are wrong.

Document Vercel environments separately:

- Development
- Preview
- Production

Frontend variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to browser code at build/runtime and must not contain secrets. Put backend/API secrets only in backend/server environments.

Do not configure backend Django as a Vercel frontend deployment. Vercel supports Django through Vercel Functions, but that is an explicit alternative path with function/runtime limitations and a separate migration/static-file strategy. The App Factory default is to prepare Django as a container for a container-friendly host.

## Makefile Standard

Create root `Makefile` with commands:

```makefile
up:
	docker compose up --build

down:
	docker compose down

logs:
	docker compose logs -f

frontend-shell:
	docker compose exec frontend sh

backend-shell:
	docker compose exec backend sh

backend-check:
	docker compose run --rm backend python manage.py check

backend-test:
	docker compose run --rm backend python manage.py test

backend-migrate:
	docker compose run --rm backend python manage.py migrate

build:
	docker compose build

prod-build:
	docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
```

Use npm for frontend commands unless the project has a documented package-manager exception. Adapt backend commands to the available backend tooling.

## Documentation

Create or update:

```txt
docs/architecture/root-architecture.md
docs/architecture/infra-architecture.md
docs/architecture/deploy.md
README.md
```

Docs must explain how to run locally, stop containers, run migrations, run tests, connect frontend/backend, connect backend/Supabase/Postgres, configure Vercel, required env vars, and what is local-only vs production.

If Render is chosen or requested, docs must also explain how the Django backend is deployed on Render, whether it uses Docker or native Python runtime, how migrations run, how env vars are configured, and how Vercel frontend CORS/API URLs point to the Render backend.

## Validation Workflow

After creating or changing infra, run when possible:

```bash
docker compose config
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=100
docker compose run --rm backend python manage.py check
docker compose down
```

If frontend exists:

```bash
docker compose run --rm frontend npm run build
```

If backend exists:

```bash
docker compose run --rm backend python manage.py test
```

If Supabase CLI is configured:

```bash
supabase status
```

Do not claim infra works unless validation was attempted.

## Architecture Scan

Run:

```bash
node scripts/scan-infra.mjs
```

or the installed skill script path from the target project.

The script should check root Compose, frontend/backend Dockerfiles, env examples, obvious secrets, Makefile, docs, Vercel guidance and Supabase structure when applicable.

## Definition of Done

Work is done only when:

- root architecture is present
- frontend Docker files exist when frontend exists
- backend Docker files exist when backend exists
- root Compose exists
- production Compose exists if requested
- env examples exist
- secrets are not committed
- Supabase structure exists when applicable
- Vercel deployment guidance exists when frontend exists
- Render deployment guidance exists when Render is chosen or requested
- Makefile exists
- docs are updated
- Docker config/build/up validation was attempted
- failures are reported honestly
