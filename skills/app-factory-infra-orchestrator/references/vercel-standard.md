# Vercel Standard

Use Vercel for frontend deployment from `/frontend`.

Typical settings:

```txt
Root Directory: frontend
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist or framework-specific output
```

## Monorepos

For a monorepo, configure the Vercel project Root Directory as `frontend`.

If using Vercel CLI, run linking/deploy commands from the monorepo root and select the intended project. Do not run the CLI from a subdirectory as the default workflow.

## Build Settings

Vercel can auto-detect install and build settings for supported frontend frameworks. App Factory frontend projects should use npm by default. Override the install command, build command or output directory only when the detected settings are wrong or a documented package-manager exception exists.

Create `frontend/vercel.json` only when the project needs custom rewrites, headers, framework settings or other explicit Vercel project configuration.

## Backend Boundary

Do not deploy Django backend as if it were a Vercel frontend project.

Vercel supports Django through Vercel Functions, but this is an explicit alternative path. If chosen, document Vercel Functions limitations, bundle/runtime constraints, static file handling and migration strategy. The App Factory default is a backend container on a container-friendly host.

For API calls:

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` or equivalent must point to backend API
- Development, Preview and Production env vars must be documented separately
- frontend env vars such as `VITE_*` must not contain secrets
- backend/API secrets must stay server-side
- CORS must allow Vercel preview/prod domains
- avoid wildcard CORS with credentials
